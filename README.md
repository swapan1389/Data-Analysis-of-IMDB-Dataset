# Data-Analysis-of-IMDB-Dataset
This repository contains the code and data for my project on IMDB data analysis. The project aims to analyze the IMDb dataset to answer questions about the movie industry, such as:

What are the most popular genres of movies? How has the average movie rating changed over time? What are the factors that contribute to a movie's success at the box office? What are the most common words used in movie titles? The project uses a variety of data analysis techniques, including:

Data cleaning and wrangling Exploratory data analysis Statistical modeling Data visualization The code for the project is written in Python and the data is stored in a CSV file. The repository also includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the analysis step-by-step.

This project was created as part of my coursework in data science. I hope that it will be a useful resource for other data analysts who are interested in analyzing IMDb data.

To get started with the project, you can clone the repository from GitHub and run the Jupyter notebook. You will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

I welcome feedback and contributions to the project. If you find any errors in the code or data, please open an issue on GitHub. If you have any ideas for new analyses, please feel free to submit a pull request.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
